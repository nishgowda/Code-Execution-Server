 * Tests executing multiple compilation commands, then executing several
 * test commands (running several resulting executable programs) and
 * verifies that there are no errors in the heap or memory leaks.  (This is
 * the same as the previous test except for freeing the commands read, and
 * checking the consistency and correctness of the heap afterwards.)
 *
 * Compile this test with the -D ENABLE_VALGRIND option to be able to use
 * valgrind with it (see the Project #7 assignment for explanation).  Then
 * REMOVE this option when you are done using valgrind, or you will NOT
 * actually be using the memory checking functions at all.  (This option
 * DISABLES them.)
